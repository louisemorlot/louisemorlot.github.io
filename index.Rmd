I am a PhD student in the [Mailand lab](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/research/proteinsignaling/mailand/) in the Center for Protein Research at University of
Copenhagen. I am part of the [Copenhagen Bioscience PhD Programme](https://cphbiosciencephd.org/) and the Molecular Mechanisms of Disease graduate school.


I am interested in understanding mechanisms of cellular stress responses and exploring pathways involved in maintaining genome integrity. During my PhD I aim to develop targeted approaches combining cell biology and high resolution omics technologies to study DNA repair mechanisms and the consequences of DNA damages.
