## Bio

I am a PhD student in the Mailand lab at the Center for Protein Research at the University of
Copenhagen. I am part of the Copenhagen Bioscience PhD Programme, a four-year PhD programme funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. 
I am interested in understanding mechanisms of cellular stress responses and exploring pathways involved in maintaining genome integrity. During my PhD I aim to develop targeted approaches combining cell biology and high resolution omics technologies to study DNA repair mechanisms and the consequences of DNA damages.
